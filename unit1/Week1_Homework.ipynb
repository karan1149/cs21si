        "In this homework, we will apply the logistic regression model we built in class and see that gender biases transfer from the word vectors to our complete model. All we will do is tell the model that 1 is for female and 0 is for male, and it will learn harmful gender stereotypes (from the word vectors, which in turn learned from Wikipedia, a dataset containing implicit bias).\n",

This means that gender biases in word vectors are so prevalent that any model built on top of them (just about any model for natural language processing) is at risk for including implicit bias. "
