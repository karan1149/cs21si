        "# Week 2 Homework: Predicting Educational Outcomes using Logistic Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "This week, following Chris's guest lecture, we'll be working on predicting educational outcomes using the machine learning basics we developed last week. Predicting educational outcomes is hugely important–doing so accurately would help educators to more accurately personalize learning experience and improve these outcomes. And with the rise of online learning platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera, we have the potential to apply these models at a scale never before imagined!\n",
        "\n",
        "There are multiple ways to predict educational outcomes–perhaps the more obvious way is to use factors like previous grades and courses taken to predict how a student will do in the future. In 2016, Aulck et al. extended this idea to [predict student dropout in higher education](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06364). \n",

The dev data is used as a means of evaluating models during training–we can see how well the model is doing on the dev set, which gives us an idea of how it is doing on data beyond the training set and helps us tune the model.

What might we input into our model? Remember, we want to predict how well a student will do on the next question given their previous performance and the concept associated with the next question. Ideally, we want to be able to tell our model the complete history of a student's performance and use it to make a prediction. \n",

We will need to give the model information about the last 39 questions, along with the concept for the 40th question (algebra or calculus). If we use the same approach to make a prediction about the 41st question, we will need to give the model information about the last 40 questions, instead of 39. We can't do this, since the input into a logistic regression model is a fixed-size vector (e.g., 300 for last week's exercises). \n",

        "The solution to this is to used a fixed window: rather than give the model all the information we can, we give it information about the last *WINDOW_SIZE* questions. Specifically, the input features (or the values that we select for our input) are: the correctness of the last *WINDOW_SIZE* questions, the concepts of the last *WINDOW_SIZE* questions, and the concept for the current question. This way, the model has enough information to make an accurate prediction, and we don't violate the fixed input constraint. Note that the fixed window involves a tradeoff: larger window sizes may result in higher accuracy, but also higher computation costs and a larger amount of data required to make a single prediction (what if a student is new to Khan Academy?). \n",

This is also the size of the weights for our logistic regression model, since the dimensions of the input must match the dimensions of the weights (remember the definition of the dot product!). Note that for each of the previous WINDOW_SIZE questions, we need 2 values: 1 for the correctness (either 0 or 1), 1 for the concept (either 0 or 1, representing algebra or calculus, respectively). We also need the concept for the current question, the question we are making the prediction on.\n",
